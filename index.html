<strong><u>Update May 14, 2016</u></strong>

<p>Nick is still suffering from the debilitating effects of neurological Lyme disease. It has recently been confirmed that he has at least three strains of major bacterial infections and severe toxicity due to heavy metals and molds. The worst symptoms he has been experiencing are cognitive dysfunction and exhaustion which prevent him from being able to think and process information clearly. His condition is worsening and he’s not able to take care of his daily needs. Additionally, due to the sensitivity of his nervous system to outside disturbances (electromagnetic waves from appliances and electrical meters), he’s unable to sleep. </p>

<p>The previous treatment we raised funds for, <a href="http://www.bxprotocol.com/">BX Protocol</a>, was unsuccessful. Although it looked very promising, Nick’s condition was too complicated to rely on such a simple approach.  Although the team at BX did all they could to help him, they were unable to help him recover with their means.</p>

<p>Since then, with the help of doctors, Nick has tried everything possible to find out the underlying conditions of why he’s still not recovering. Despite being considered specialists in treating Lyme disease, they couldn’t see the complete picture of his issues.</p>

<strong>Potential New Treatment</strong>

<p>However, we’ve recently found an institution, called the <a href="http://nycim.com//">New York Center for Innovative Medicine</a>, which has a world-renowned doctor and staff, specializing in treating Lyme and other chronic health issues. They have been the first institution Nick has been evaluated by which provided a clear comprehensive picture of his condition and provided a comprehensive treatment program.</p>

<p>It’s wonderful news to have finally found a competent specialist; however, it comes with a price. <i>The whole treatment would cost around $35,000.</i></p>

<p>So far, this seems like the best option, however it is very expensive. So we are still looking for Lyme specialists and keeping our options open… hoping to find a less expensive treatment.</p>

<p>We feel deeply regretful to have to request donations yet again, but unfortunately, in our times, Lyme disease patients and their treatment get minimal help from insurance companies or the government, so patients are left all alone to find alternative health care options.</p>

<p>Nick’s funds are nearly exhausted, so we must ask again…</p>

<strong>We Humbly Request Your Help</strong>

<p>With heartfelt gratitude, we again request your assistance. We hope to raise the funds within the next month, so that Nick can begin his treatment ASAP. The longer we wait, the more his health will deteriorate. So this is urgent.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your continued support and compassion.</p>

<p>May Nick and all other Lyme disease sufferers continue to receive the support they need!</p>

<a id="the-detailed-story" class="anchor" href="#the-detailed-story" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Detailed Story</h3>

<p>In 2011 Nicholas was diagnosed with Lyme Disease. When he first went to the doctors, the blood results came back negative, so the doctors told him he didn’t have Lyme. He still wasn’t feeling well, so he went back to the doctors a second time, and they did a more accurate blood test, Western Blot, which determined he had Lyme Disease. He was given oral antibiotics, but the antibiotics didn’t fully resolve his symptoms, though he felt much relief.  </p>

<p>In 2012, he began to develop more serious symptoms like chronic fatigue, swollen glands, and nasal congestion, but he didn’t connect them with Lyme.  When seeing doctors for these symptoms, he wasn’t treated properly.</p>

<p>By the spring of 2013, he began to have trouble thinking, so he went to the doctors again and had a spinal tap done. It confirmed that the Lyme had spread to his brain, causing him to have neurological Lyme Disease. He was given an intravenous treatment of antibiotics for 28 days. This procedure requires a PICC line (peripherally inserted central catheter) which is a form of intravenous tube that was inserted into his arm through to his chest and would pump antibiotics into his body daily. The treatment was working, but because the standard treatment regulated by the Center for Disease Control only allows 28 days, he was not given any more and was told he was cured from Lyme. During the fall and winter of 2013, he still wasn’t feeling well so he went back to the doctors and they told him they couldn’t do anything else. He had received the standard treatment for Lyme and regardless of how he felt he was dismissed as not having Lyme.</p>

<p>During the summer of 2014, he severely relapsed. He was administered another spinal tap and again put on the same IV antibiotics for another month. This time around, he visited another doctor who was able to extend his antibiotics for another 2 months. After 3 months of being on IV antibiotics, he still was not feeling well. The Lyme had built up a resistance to the antibiotics from the first treatment in 2013, so it did not work.</p>

<p>In the winter of 2014, he began to take herbal supplements, but they have been still unsuccessful. Because of his condition, he has been unable to work and is on Medicaid. However, Medicaid will not cover doctor fees and treatments outside of their treatment guidelines for Lyme, which have all been unsuccessful in treating his condition.</p>

<p>During this time, he has tried all kinds of treatments, and nothing has brought about substantial results. His condition is quickly deteriorating and has become urgent. His symptoms--which include severe fatigue, body aches, insomnia, memory loss, poor cognitive functions, poor appetite and digestion, depression, and the overall deterioration of physical and mental health--are increasing day by day. It's a torturous and frightening place to be in, where his life is slowly withering away.</p>

<p>We appreciate any generosity that you can show in support of this young man's life.</p>

<p>At the end of Nicholas’s treatment, any remaining funds will be donated to institutions doing research on Lyme Disease and its treatment.</p>
