<a id="the-detailed-story" class="anchor" href="#the-detailed-story" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Detailed Story</h3>

<p>In 2011 Nicholas was diagnosed with Lyme. When he first went to the doctors, the blood results came back negative, so the doctors told him he didn’t have Lyme. He still wasn’t feeling well, so he went back to the doctors a second time, and they did a more accurate blood test, Western Blot, which determined he had Lyme disease. He was given oral antibiotics, but the antibiotics didn’t fully resolve his symptoms, though he felt much relief.  </p>

<p>In 2012, he began to develop more serious symptoms like chronic fatigue, swollen glands, and nasal congestion, but he didn’t connect them with Lyme.  When seeing doctors for these symptoms, he wasn’t treated properly.</p>

<p>By the spring of 2013, he began to have trouble thinking, so he went to the doctors again and had a spinal tap done. It confirmed that the Lyme had spread to his brain, causing him to have neurological Lyme disease. He was given an intravenous treatment of antibiotics for 28 days. This procedure requires a PICC line (peripherally inserted central catheter) which is a form of intravenous tube that was inserted into his arm through to his chest and would pump antibiotics into his body daily. The treatment was working, but because the standard treatment regulated by the Center for Disease Control only allows 28 days, he was not given any more and was told he was cured from Lyme. During the fall and winter of 2013, he still wasn’t feeling well so he went back to the doctors and they told him they couldn’t do anything else. He had received the standard treatment for Lyme and regardless of how he felt he was dismissed as not having Lyme.</p>

<p>During the summer of 2014, he severely relapsed. He was administered another spinal tap and again put on the same IV antibiotics for another month. This time around, he visited another doctor who was able to extend his antibiotics for another 2 months. After 3 months of being on IV antibiotics, he still was not feeling well. The Lyme had built up a resistance to the antibiotics from the first treatment in 2013, so it did not work.</p>

<p>In the winter of 2014, he began to take herbal supplements, but they have been still unsuccessful. Because of his condition, he has been unable to work and is on Medicaid. However, Medicaid will not cover doctor fees and treatments outside of their treatment guidelines for Lyme, which have all been unsuccessful in treating his condition.</p>

<p>During this time, he has tried all kinds of treatments, and nothing has brought about substantial results. His condition is quickly deteriorating and has become urgent. His symptoms--which include severe fatigue, body aches, insomnia, memory loss, poor cognitive functions, poor appetite and digestion, depression, and the overall deterioration of physical and mental health--are increasing day by day . It's a torturous and frightening place to be in, where his life is slowly withering away. He has found a viable treatment option yet has almost no financial resources left. The goal is a lofty $20,000, which would pay for a year's treatment. </p>

<p>We appreciate any generosity that you can show in support of this young man's life. </p>

<p>At the end of Nicholas’s treatment, any remaining funds will be donated to institutions doing research on Lyme disease and its treatment.</p>
